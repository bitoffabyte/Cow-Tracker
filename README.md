# Name of Project
Moometer

Moometer is one unique way to solve three problems faced by cattle owners. It is a three pronged fork, solves three problems with one unique solution, GPS tracking, health monitoring and Anti-theft safety.

### Unique Selling Points

* GPS tracking.
* Health monitoring.    
* Anti-theft
* 


## Implementation: 

The final project is in the form of a cattle collar that has various sensors inside it in the form of a housing. It has the web-app interface that can be inititated and connected to the collar.

## Technology Stack  
React<br/> Nodejs<br/> ExpressJS<br/> Arduino<br/> Fusion 360<br/> Firebase<br/> Proteus

### Fusion 360

Basic CAD of the whole project

### React

Used react to make a web app to display the details of the cows for each user

### Node + Express JS

Created a middleware backend to interface between the arduino and firebase

### Arduino

Used the arduino to get the vitals and the location of the cows and to detect theft detection, also sends all the data to the server 

### Firebase

Used firebase for authentication and realtime database to get live updates of cows

### Proteus

Used Proteus to create and simulate the circuit

## Prerequisites

The following dependencies should be installed to run the code. 

```
package 1
package 2
```

## Challanges

1. Getting Google maps API 
2. Sending the data from arduino to firebase directly with GSM module
3. Configuring GSM module
4. Posting data to the server over GSM module
5. Finding a way to make it theft-proof

## Getting Started


how to run the project

git clone https://github.com/bitoffabyte/Cow-Tracker.git
cd Cow-Tracker

### For website

cd frontend npm i
npm start


### For backend

cd backend
npm i
node server

## Future Aspects
1. Adding a Locking mechanism 
2. Getting google maps API 
3. Adding automatic cow addition for the farmers 
4. Adding an SMS option for farmers 
5. Adding an SOS alert to nearby farmers
6. Solar powering for efficiency.
